# Nepobabies: Labor Market Entry and Nepotistic Behavior of Young Adults

This repository contains the datasets, tools for analysis, results, reproducibility package, and final report of the ECN 310 nepobabies team project.

## Abstract
We examine the effects of young adults entering the workforce during competitive labor markets and whether those seeking jobs during high unemployment times will be more likely to be in their parent’s occupations. We create a framework where young adults working in the same industries as their parents are defined as products of nepotism and examine how such products of nepotism find employment under varying economic conditions. Our analysis uses two-sample t-tests and chi-square analysis to examine the differences in rates of nepotism for varying levels of unemployment. Using data on young adults hired between 1960 and 2022, we find that there is a greater likelihood of gaining employment within the same industry as one’s parents during poor economic conditions with high unemployment.

# Nepobabies: Labor Market Entry and Nepotistic Behavior of Young Adults

This repository contains the datasets, tools for analysis, results, reproducibility package, and final report of the ECN 310 nepobabies team project.

## Abstract
We examine the effects of young adults entering the workforce during competitive labor markets and whether those seeking jobs during high unemployment times will be more likely to be in their parents' occupations. We create a framework where young adults working in the same industries as their parents are defined as products of nepotism and examine how trends of such nepotistic relationships behave under varying economic conditions. Our analysis uses chi-square tests of association, a logistic regression model, and a test of correlation to examine the differences in rates of nepotism for varying levels of unemployment. Using data from the General Social Survey (GSS) on young adults hired between 1960 and 2018, we find no greater likelihood of gaining employment within the same industry as ones parents during tighter labor markets, i.e., higher unemployment. We then use two-sample t-tests and chi-square tests to examine demographic trends of nepobabies. The significant findings are that nepotistic relationships are found in much greater frequency between parents and children of the same sex and that nepobabies feel that they have greater job security.

## Nepo-Babies Group Contract
#### @rhrabino and @rpseely 
Group behaviors expected of each member:

### Temporal
1.	All group members will be **punctual**. Meetings will start seven minutes after the agreed start time, and everyone should be there and ready by then.
2.	We should turn up to all meetings unless it has been agreed beforehand or unless there are unavoidable events such as illness.
3.	All group members will remain in the meeting until (a) all tasks for that meeting are completed, or (b) until we can no longer be productive.
4.	Breaks will be decided by unanimous consent, and breaks will not exceed twenty minutes in length.
5.	For rules three and four, if we disagree, we will have to compromise.
6.	All meetings must allow for a break of up to 15% of the allotted time, regardless of agreement on breaks.
________________________________________
### Procedural
1.	All group members will come to the meetings prepared by
(a) reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
(b) coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
2.	Tasks that group members agree to undertake should be completed to the agreed deadline. If it looks as though there will be a problem meeting a deadline, the person concerned should notify and/or seek help from other members of the team in time to avoid a delay.
3.	There will be an assimilation period at the end of the session to ensure all tasks are completed.
4.	Each group member has the right to point out whether any of these rules are being broken (*nicely*).
________________________________________
### Behavioral
1.	The group will actively seek a consensus based on the opinions of both members.
2.	Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions.
3.	Bigoted remarks are not acceptable.
4.	Aggressive and dominating behavior is not acceptable.
5.	If someone breaks a rule, the other team member is owed a Dunkin drink, or drink of choice not exceeding $8. 
6.	If we disagree on whether a rule was broken, we will consult a third party (Isabella Madison Bert).

### Roles
1.	Switch on and off acting as secretary each meeting.
2.	The role of the secretary is to keep track of which tasks have been completed and what our next steps are. They must write a short report and submit it in our GitHub repository.

### Methods for resolving an impasse:
- Step 1: The group members will isolate areas of disagreement, and the group will come to a consensus. If no consensus is reached, proceed to Step 2.
- Step 2: The group members will compromise on the area of disagreement and seek help as needed.

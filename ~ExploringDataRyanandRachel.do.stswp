 **the next few lines are for getting an idea of those variables look like 
tab dateintv
tab educ
tab fndjob2

**this gives us important information on the number of observation and descriptive statistics of important variables

**this examines the relationship between education and finding a job through a relative

save "GSSclean_noRDs.dta" , replace

**paind10 maind10 indus10 
**Creating dummy variable for nepobaby = 1 if respondent is in the same industry as their mother or father, 0 otherwise
gen nepobaby = ((indus10 == paind10)|(indus10 == maind10))

**Creating a new variable for year hired
**** Must make determination on missing variables, i.e. every four years yearsjob asked.
gen yearsjob_int = round(yearsjob)

** Creating variable for the year (yearsjob_int) respondents obtained job
gen yearhire = (year - yearsjob_int)

**Creating new date variable for full interview date, including year.
gen flintdate = string(dateintv) + string(year)

**Getting rid of missing data
drop if year < 1975
drop if missing(dateintv)

**Not working yet! But trying to create a variable that makes the full interview date variable into an integer
gen flintdate_int = int(flintdate)

**Creating new variable for full hire date, including year.
gen flhiredate = string(dateintv) + string(yearhire)
**This variable includes the rounded values (.25 year and .75 years as 0 and 1 respectably)
**There are many missing values for all respondents who have not answered the yearsjob question. Prof. Buzard? Drop it? Data cleaning needed.

**Converting the full interview and hire dates into a Stata date format.
gen flhiredate1 = date(substr(flhiredate, 3, .), "MDY")
**Did not work.

**Suggested code from ChatGPT to recode as Stata date format
**Not working yet!
// Extract day, month, and year components
gen day = mod(flintdate, 100)
gen month = floor(mod(flintdate/100, 100))
gen year = floor(flintdate/10000)

// Convert to Stata date variable
gen date_var = date(year, month, day)

// Display the results
list flintdate date_var
